## DESCRIPTION

HTAuth is a pure ruby replacement for the Apache support programs htdigest and
htpasswd.  Command line and API access are provided for access to htdigest and
htpasswd files.

## FEATURES

HTAuth provides to drop in commands *htdigest-ruby* and *htpasswd-ruby* that
can manipulate the digest and passwd files in the same manner as Apache's
original commands.

*htdigest-ruby* and *htpasswd-ruby* are command line compatible with *htdigest*
and *htpasswd*.  They support the same exact same command line options as the
originals, and have some extras.

Additionally, you can access all the functionality of *htdigest-ruby* and
*htpasswd-ruby* through an API.

## SYNOPSIS

### htpasswd-ruby command line application


    Usage:
    htpasswd-ruby [-cmdpsD] passwordfile username
    htpasswd-ruby -b[cmdpsD] passwordfile username password

    htpasswd-ruby -n[mdps] username
    htpasswd-ruby -nb[mdps] username password

    -b, --batch                      Batch mode, get the password from the command line, rather than prompt
    -c, --create                     Create a new file; this overwrites an existing file.
    -d, --crypt                      Force CRYPT encryption of the password (default).
    -D, --delete                     Delete the specified user.
    -h, --help                       Display this help.
    -m, --md5                        Force MD5 encryption of the password (default on Windows).
    -n, --stdout                     Do not update the file; Display the results on stdout instead.
    -p, --plaintext                  Do not encrypt the password (plaintext).
    -s, --sha1                       Force SHA encryption of the password.
    -v, --version                    Show version info.

### htdigest-ruby command line application

    Usage: htdigest-ruby [options] passwordfile realm username
    -c, --create                     Create a new digest password file; this overwrites an existing file.
    -D, --delete                     Delete the specified user.
    -h, --help                       Display this help.
    -v, --version                    Show version info.

### API Usage

    HTAuth::DigestFile.open("some.htdigest") do |df|
      df.add_or_update('someuser', 'myrealm', 'a password')
      df.delete('someolduser', 'myotherrealm')
    end

    HTAuth::PasswdFile.open("some.htpasswd", HTAuth::File::CREATE) do |pf|
      pf.add('someuser', 'a password', 'md5')
      pf.add('someotheruser', 'a different password', 'sha1')
    end
